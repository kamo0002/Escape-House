 * "Zorld of Wuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.

 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 * tries to interpret the line as a two word command. 
 *
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 * the known commands, and invokes a relevant method on the Game object.
